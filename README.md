# Utilitydtireduxconnectmap
> a convenience function for writing simple redux connects

## Usage

**This component expects an ES6 environment**, and so if you are using this in an app,
you should drop in a polyfill library - it has been tested with [babel-polyfill] but
[core-js] or [es6-shim] may also work.

[babel-polyfill]: https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/
[core-js]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js
[es6-shim]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-shim

## Install

```bash
npm i -S utility-dti-reduxconnectmap
```

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```
